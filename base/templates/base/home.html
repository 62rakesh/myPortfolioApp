                    <hr>
                    <p>I have been doing freelance web development using python as a backend language and Django
                    as a framework and SQL database, for frontend we are using HTML/CSS and JavaScript</p>

                    <h4>How I Learn?</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>It's basically reverse engineering & build ugly prototypes first.</p>

                    <p>I can learn just about anything by having a final product to tear apart piece by piece.
                    I break the code where I need to figure out why things work the way they do. Documentation
                    is just a reference.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>After spending more than 5 years into QA working as an SDET and contributing as a developer
                    I would like to contribute more towards software development</p>

                    <p>Apart from building small projects I would like to enter a position where I can be part
                    of a bigger team & learn from others with more experience than myself. </p>
